\citeauthor{rendel15automatic} (\citeyear{rendel15automatic}) present two functional programming languages on which defunctionalization and refunctionalization, respectively, are totally defined. These languages, called the Codata and the Data Fragment, support, respectively, copattern matching and the usual pattern matching of functional languages. \citeauthor{rendel15automatic} intend these languages to be fragments of a common language, called Uroboro, that has both pattern and copattern matching. In this thesis, we formally define Uroboro and we develop automatic program transformations for this language. We extend \citeauthor{rendel15automatic}'s automatic de- and refunctionalization for the Codata and Data Fragments to all of Uroboro. We also identify a generalization, which we call extraction, of some of the steps which make up these transformations. As a by-product of our work, we shine some light on an asymmetry between pattern and copattern matching.
