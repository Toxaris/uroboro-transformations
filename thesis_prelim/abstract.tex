Rendel et al. present two functional programming languages on which Reynolds' defunctionalization and Danvy's refunctionalization, respectively, are totally defined. These languages, called the Codata and the Data Fragment, support Abel's copattern matching and its dual, the usual pattern matching of functional languages, respectively. Rendel et al. intend these languages to be fragments of a common language, called Uroboro, that has both pattern and copattern matching. In this thesis, we formally define Uroboro and we develop automatic program transformations for this language. We extend Rendel et al.'s automatic de- and refunctionalization for the Codata and Data Fragments to all of Uroboro. We also identify a generalization, which we call extraction, of some of the steps which make up these transformations. As a by-product of our work, we shine a light on an asymmetry between pattern and copattern matching.
